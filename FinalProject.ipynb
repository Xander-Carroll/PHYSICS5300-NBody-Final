    "### A. Project Proposal\n",
    "\n",
    "I will build a numerical solver for the N-Body gravitational problem. I will implement a timestep integrator such as leapfrog, verify the behavior on simple systems (e.g., two-body orbits), and then run larger simulations to examine stability and emergent structure. If time allows, I would like to examine the problem for large values of N (~$10^4$ bodies). The resulting trajectories will be visualized using Manim or a similar animation tool. All code, animations, and documentation will be organized in a GitHub repository. There are a large number of resources (papers and pre-existing projects) for this problem. There is also great documentation for the python libraries we have been using."
